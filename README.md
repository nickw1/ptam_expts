# Web front end to PTAM

This repository will contain experiments to attempt to add a web front end to [PTAM](https://github.com/williammc/ptam_plus), starting with [Thorsten Bux's fork](https://github.com/ThorstenBux/ptam_plus/tree/test/compiling)

**The test application, not fully working yet, is in the [ptam](ptam/) directory.**

In addition to this, it contains initial experiments with OpenCV.js and communicating between JavaScript and C++/WASM, which might be useful for reference if you are just starting to play around with this. To be clear - currently I am no expert, so apologies for any bad code! ;-)
